                If you look close enough, you realise that the promise of 
                change is deeply embedded even in those things that seem permanent.</p>
    
            <p id="two">Here are some of those things that we can't imagine the city without — 
            they are ubiquitous and you might find them just about anywhere, across place and time, 
            but still they herald the dynamism of New York City.</p>

                    <p>Fire escapes began to appear on buildings in New York City in the 1860s, after a number of fatal house fires, when they were first required to provide emergency egress for tenement buildings — buildings that served largely as housing for the urban poor, who had immigrated into the city during the period. During the early 20th century, fire escapes were added to many loft buildings after new labor laws were passed. While they served a utilitarian purpose at the time, today in some historic districts, they have become significant features that define the streetscape as they were elaborately detailed and designed to complement facades.</p>

                    are constantly driving in and out. Parking lots lodged in between buildings,

                    <p>New Yorkers have long groused about finding — and paying for — places to leave their cars. But now, inflation, the housing crisis and post-pandemic aftershocks have made what was already an urban blood sport nearly untenable. Drivers who find themselves priced out of expensive garages are forced to hunt for parking spots increasingly crowded out by dumpsters, dining sheds, bike lanes and a glut of cars. This past fiscal year, the police issued 8.4 million tickets, one of the highest totals on record.</p>

The green color, found on some roofs in the city, is the natural hue of oxidized copper showing the age and resilience of the roof structure.</p>

Colonists gathered at what is now City Hall Park and toppled Bowling Green Park’s statue of King George. Since then, people have taken to the city's streets, plazas, and parks to voice their dissent during periods of unrest. Today, the city’s streets and parks continue to serve as places of assembly and calls to action. Black Lives Matter has regularly gathered in Foley Square, Union Square Park, Washington Square Park, and other downtown parks, while proponents of international movements meet daily in Dag Hammarskjöld Plaza near the United Nations.</p>

                    <p>NYC is a city where the supernatural thrives, where even in the midst of skyrocketing rent prices, a psychic can be found in every neighbourhood at the drop of a hat. But at one point, the fraud amongst them was so intense that a law was passed in 1967 prohibiting fortune telling as a class B misdemeanour. To exist today, they have to classify themselves as pretty much anything else (entertainers, life coaches, etc.) and are legally required to present a disclaimer to clients that clarifies the readings are part “of a show or exhibition solely for the purpose of entertainment or amusement.” But they continue to thrive in this city because New Yorkers are always in search of a shared, empathetic experience, and for someone to tell us what to do next in a city where “anything can happen”. After centuries, the industry is not only still alive but as resilient as ever, growing stronger and more accessible in a digital age. And as long as humans have questions, they'll be waiting with answers.</p>

                    <p>As the average Manhattan building age increases with every year, and housing in short supply, many building elements rapidly deteriorate that necessitate scaffolding so that repairs can be conducted safely. There are now over 4,000 shed permits currently issued in Manhattan alone, almost half of all permits in New York City. According to NYC buildings, the duration statistic cited is 243 days, but most New Yorkers know scaffolding that’s been up for many more months or even years. While the primary reason is to protect pedestrians from falling debris while repairs are completed, the truth is that a lot of building owners will just put up scaffolding rather than actually repair the building because it happens to be cheaper that simply renovating.</p>

                    <p>Manhattan is the world's largest and most significant graffiti capital. The roots of urban art and graffiti can be traced back to the eighties on the walls of the concrete jungle. Generally, the scene consists of 3 entities — gangs using city walls to establish territory and transmit underground messages hidden in visual codes, professional skateboarders and hip-hop artists (two other arts that were also developing around the same time) who use it to as an opportunity to rebel against conventions with what is perceived as vandalism, and finally, activists and artists who recognize the potential in urban media to disseminate messages in an unmediated and direct way. Today, graffiti and sticker art is it’s own specialization, with some taggers and artists remaining anonymous ghosts identified only by their art, and others selling their works at upmarket galleries and exhibitions.</p>

                    <p>Mom-and-pop shops are cornerstones every community, but they are dying under the pressure of rising rents and giant online stores like Amazon. Data on small businesses is notoriously scarce, but according to the Chamber of Commerce, 8% of small businesses today fail within their first year, and about 65% by their tenth year in business. The pandemic certainly didn’t help. But according to owners of these businesses, the number one reason for their demise — at least in NYC — is that the owners didn’t own the building and ended up being priced out. While the trend of small businesses dying out continues in tandem with major retailers closing outlets in the city, citing theft as a primary reason, there is some hope to be found in the increasing patronage from New Yorkers and tourists alike emerging after the pandemic. </p>

Budgeting issues and a lack of changing regulations that accommodate for easier, cleaner waste disposal means that curbside waste, whether that includes furniture, pallets, or plain old garbage, isn’t going away anytime soon.</p>
