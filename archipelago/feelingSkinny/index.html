            <h1>On Feeling Skinny</h1>

            <p>For the longest time my mind didn’t know the phrase “feeling skinny,” but my body did. When I would starve myself to keep my weight under that 60kg mark so much so that my skinny jeans would fit loose because my stomach had shrunken under my ribs, I would look in the mirror and think “I feel sucked in and I look sexy.” When my stomach would grumble in the middle of class because I hadn’t eaten anything besides corn chips for the last two days, I would catch a glimpse of my body in the window and think “It’s worth it because look how flat my stomach is!”</p>
    
            <p>Feeling skinny was so important to me. I would purposely starve myself the day of a party, so I could show up with the appearance of washboard abs and get drunk quicker than if I was fed just so I could forget how miserable I really was. In hindsight it was so pathetic.</p>
    
            <p>I realise now that “feeling skinny” is a patriarchal, media-endorsed mode of self-torture. “Feeling skinny” means feeling starved. “Feeling skinny” means being physically weak all the time, but convincing yourself that other people’s perception of you warrants the pain. “Feeling skinny” is prioritising the appearance of health without doing the work to get there.</p>
    
            <p>I don’t want to feel skinny anymore. I want to feel soft and plush, and well-fed and satiated. I want to radiate being full, both physically and metaphorically. I want my body to know that I am taking care of her.</p>
