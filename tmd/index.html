            We conducted a research study of student journalists at The New School, in an attempt to 
            better understand their news literacy, media diet and industry ambitions. 
            What we found, unsurprisingly, was a community of social-media dependent student journalists.

            If you’ve been browsing social media lately, chances are you've come
            across a post informing you about the news. As social media democratizes
            news production and distribution for publications large, small and
            individuals alike, it also draws a larger crowd, particularly Gen Z into
            its news ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Student journalists today are no exception to this. As social media news
            continues to constitute an ever-growing segment of their media diets,
            the reporting process for student journalists begins to be influenced by
            it. As Gen Z is constituted entirely of digital natives who likely don’t
            remember a world without the internet, it isn’t surprising that the ways
            in which they produce news differs greatly from the traditional
            reporting of the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Gen Z consumes more news daily than any other generation, the
            means by which they do so is vastly different. Scrolling feeds and
            notifications are key to keeping Gen Z engaged in the news, with the
            data telling the same story. According to a May 2022 study by 
            <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/insights/industry/technology/gen-z-news-consumption.html" target="_blank">Deloitte Insights</a>
            , 51% of Gen Z teens and 33% of Gen Z adults (the range that
            makes up the college-aged demographic) got their news from social media,
            making it the most popular means by which this generation keeps up to
            date with news and current events.
          </p>
          <h2>What Our Data Tells Us</h2>
          <p>
            According to our research, 90% of student journalists at The New School
            who participated in this study resort to social media platforms for
            their consumption of news. The age demographic for this study ranged
            from 19 to 23 year olds, a dominant range for undergraduate students
            enrolled in college. For efficiency purposes, this 
            <a href="https://forms.gle/2Tc69MEEEVfRDekK7">form</a>
            exclusively targeted undergraduate students enrolled in Journalism majors or minors
            at The New School.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nearly 70% of these student journalists consume news on a daily basis,
            while the remaining 30% frequent the news a couple of times in a week.
            This showcases how student journalists are included in the Gen-Z
            demographic who are dependent on social media platforms to feed their
            news diets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Amongst platforms like TikTok, Twitter, and Reddit, to name a few, a
            majority of the respondents cited Instagram as their primary source for
            news. Facebook and Snapchat were the least popular social platforms for
            news consumption, with zero respondents citing them as a news source.
            Over half of the respondents get their news from aggregator services
            such as Apple News or Google News and additionally 75% of respondents
            have print/digital subscriptions to publications such as The New York
            Times, The Washington Post, New York Magazine, The New Yorker and The
            Guardian.
          </p>

          <img class="viz" src="assets/3.png">

          <p>
            Although social media platforms are a favored news source for student
            journalists at The New School, none of the respondents aim to pursue any
            form of social media journalism as a career. When asked what form of
            journalism they’re most interested in, 75% expressed their interest in
            writing for Print/Digital publications, 20% intend to pursue
            Video/Documentary journalism and 5% aimed to work for Podcasting
            publications.
          </p>
          <p>
            While social media journalism as a career is not a proven interest
            amongst student journalists at The New School, the use of social media
            platforms as a means of sourcing information remains prevalent, but at
            what cost?
          </p>
          <h2>Risks And Repercussions</h2>
          <p>
            An article published by The Guardian titled 
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/feb/22/what-happens-if-teens-get-their-news-from-tiktok" target="_blank">"What Happens If Teens Get
            Their News From TikTok,"</a> states that TikTok, Youtube, Facebook and
            Twitter platforms collectively “supply 66% of young people [as] their
            main news source, and all rely on algorithms.” By showing viewers what
            they want to see, we risk increasing “polarized views in society, as
            people are exposed to a less diverse diet of actual current affairs.”
            These limitations are placed on any consumer, irrespective of their
            professions but for a journalist, user-specific algorithms generated by
            platforms like TikTok or Twitter may risk one’s pursuit of the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            A primary lesson for any reporter begins with source diversity. Ten
            quotes from the same person will only tell one story, so we are taught
            early on to broaden our horizons for the sake of the people and for the
            sake of their stories. A similar concept of diversity can be said for us
            as readers and writers of the news – if an individual’s news diet lacks
            range, then an individual’s ability to look beyond their own perspective
            is weakened. Contributing writer, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/01/21/media-journalism-future-527294" target="_blank">Nicholas Carr of Politico</a>, dissects
            how our digital track history confines us to sorting algorithms by
            companies like Meta and Twitter, where “our past choices also become the
            template for the information we receive in the future.” As individuals
            we continue to coexist in this digital confinement where “each of us
            gets locked into our own self-defining feedback loop.” It’s a world
            where “bias gets amplified, context gets lost.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In our research process we noted that most respondents are subscribed to
            The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian and New York
            Magazine. Whether these respondents consume news on The New York Times
            website via a print subscription or if they simply engage with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nytimes/?hl=en" target="_blank">@nytimes</a>
            on Instagram, the perspectives that students are encountering are the
            same, the only difference being perhaps differing levels of depth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similar to a number of universities in the United States, The New School
            sponsors subscriptions to a few outlets for its student body, namely The
            New York Times and The New Yorker’s archive section in entirety. Student
            journalists at The New School are a part of an institution where
            mainstream media coverage is encouraged and even subsidized. It is in
            the hands of individual professors to encourage students to diversify
            their own media diet, either by themselves going beyond the syllabus and
            mandating that students read a range of writing, or pushing their
            students to engage more deeply with local news outside the classroom.
            Consequently, the exposure that a student has to journalism that doesn’t
            perpetually align with their perspectives is thoroughly dependent on the
            individual, as our academic system relies on a unified set of resources.
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            As student journalists at The New School the onus is on us and the
            designers of our curricula to ensure that we immerse ourselves in a
            range of journalistic forms beyond those delivered to us by the
            algorithms. As models of trust on social media shift towards those that
            tend towards the individualistic and personal, the considerations of
            community and the public sphere can get lost. Carr writes that “our
            choices about what we watch, read and listen to, on display through our
            online profiles and posts, become statements about ourselves and our
            beliefs, signifiers of our tribal allegiance.” It is evident that our
            behavior online manifests in what we choose to write, and ultimately
            represent, as journalists. So if the institution that is training
            student journalists to be the future of the industry’s workforce, does
            little to encourage or even inform them of the risks that come with an
            unbalanced news diet, how are they to comprehend the loss of perspective
            that’s at stake?
