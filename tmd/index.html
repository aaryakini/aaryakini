            If you’ve been browsing social media lately, chances are you've come
            across posts telling you about the news. As social media democratizes
            news production and distribution for publications large and small and
            individuals alike, it also draws a larger crowd, particularly Gen Z into
            its news ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Student journalists today are no exception to this, and as social media
            news continues to constitute an ever-growing segment of their media
            diets, their own reporting begins to be influenced by it. As Gen Z is
            constituted entirely of digital natives who likely don’t remember a
            world without the internet, it isn’t surprising that the ways in which
            they produce news differs greatly from the traditional reporting of the
            past.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Gen Z consumes more news daily than any other generation, the
            means by which they do so is vastly different. Scrolling feeds and
            notifications are key to keeping Gen Z engaged in the news, with the
            data telling the same story. According to a May 2022 study by
            <span class="link"
              ><a
                href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/insights/industry/technology/gen-z-news-consumption.html"
                >Deloitte Insights</a
              ></span
            >, 51% of Gen Z teens and 33% of Gen Z adults (the
            range that makes up the college-aged demographic) got their news from
            social media, making it the most popular means by which this generation
            keeps up to date with news and current events.
          </p>
    
          <h2>What Our Data Tells Us</h2>
    
          <p>
            According to our research, 90% of student journalists at The New School
            who participated in this study resort to social media platforms for
            their consumption of news. The age demographic for this study ranged
            from 19 to 23 year olds, a dominant range for undergraduate students
            enrolled in college. For efficiency purposes, this form exclusively
            targeted undergraduate students enrolled in Journalism majors or minors
            at The New School.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Nearly 70% of these student journalists consume news on a daily basis,
            while the remaining 30% frequent the news a couple of times in a week.
            This showcases how student journalists are included in the Gen-Z
            demographic who are dependent on social media platforms to feed their
            news diets.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Amongst platforms like TikTok, Twitter, and Reddit, to name a few, a
            majority of the respondents cited Instagram as their primary source for
            news. Facebook and Snapchat were the least popular social platforms for
            news consumption, with zero respondents citing them as a news source.
            Over half of the respondents get their news from aggregator services
            such as Apple News or Google News and additionally 75% of respondents
            have print/digital subscriptions to publications such as The New York
            Times, The Washington Post, New York Magazine, The New Yorker and The
            Guardian.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Although social media platforms are a favored news source for student
            journalists at The New School, none of the respondents aim to pursue any
            form of social media journalism as a career. When asked what form of
            journalism they’re most interested in, 75% expressed their interest in
            writing for Print/Digital publications, 20% intend to pursue
            Video/Documentary journalism and 5% aimed to work for Podcasting
            publications.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            While social media journalism as a career is not a proven interest
            amongst student journalists at The New School, the use of social media
            platforms as a means of sourcing information remains prevalent, but at
            what cost?
          </p>
    
          <p>
            An article published by The Guardian titled ‘What Happens If Teens Get
            Their News From TikTok,’ states that TikTok, Youtube, Facebook and
            Twitter platforms collectively “supply 66% of young people [as] their
            main news source, and all rely on algorithms.” By showing viewers what
            they want to see, we risk increasing “polarized views in society, as
            people are exposed to a less diverse diet of actual current affairs.”
            These limitations are placed on any consumer, irrespective of their
            professions but for a journalist, user-specific algorithms generated by
            platforms like TikTok or Twitter may risk one’s pursuit of the truth.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            A primary lesson for any reporter begins with source diversity. Ten
            quotes from the same person will only tell one story, so we are taught
            early on to broaden our horizons for the sake of the people and for the
            sake of their stories. A similar concept of diversity can be said for us
            as readers and writers of the news – if an individual’s news diet lacks
            range, then an individual’s ability to look beyond their own perspective
            is weakened. This Op-Ed published by Politico dissects how our digital
            track history confines us to sorting algorithms by companies like Meta
            and Twitter, where “our past choices also become the template for the
            information we receive in the future.” As individuals we continue to
            coexist in this digital confinement where “each of us gets locked into
            our own self-defining feedback loop.” It’s a world where “bias gets
            amplified, context gets lost.”
