            <p lang="en-GB">Dear Maithu,<br>
                Congratulations! You made it. You have accomplished so much in your eighteen years, but more importantly, you have taken on your age with grace and humility, constantly learning from your mistakes, recognising your strengths, always listening and eternally loving. You have always been and still are a beautiful person with so much to give to others. It has been my honour to watch you grow, and I hope you know that no words can articulate the love and protectiveness I feel over you. I was thinking of what I could get you as a present marking your departure into adulthood when I realised that the best thing I can give you is my experiences so that you never have to make the same mistakes as I did, to learn from them. While I can’t give you all my memories, as much as I wish I could, this little guide is the closest I can get to it.
            </p>
            <p lang="en-GB">It is full of my knowledge on everything from friendships, to drugs, to school, and love. It is all I know about how to survive life on your own away from the world that brings you comfort. I know it’s dreary, but things really do only get harder from here. But the small moments— like when you hang out with friends you really love, cook a hearty meal for yourself, do your laundry on a hard day, or push yourself to go to the doctor alone when you are sick — make it truly worth it. They will give you an unmatched sense of pride in yourself and your ability to keep going at the chore of survival even when times get tough.
            </p>
            <p lang="en-GB">Like you always say, love you and be safe. You need to come back to us sound and happy always.
            </p>
            <p lang="en-GB">With big hugs and many hesitant kisses,<br>
            Aarya
